# 📊 Institutional Data Project  
_Automated Data Quality & Reporting Framework for Institutional Data_

## 🔎 Project Overview  
This project simulates the work of an ** Data Analyst** by building an end-to-end workflow for analyzing, cleaning, and reporting higher education data. The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in:  
- **Data collection & management** (SQL, CSV/Excel ingestion, cleaning with Python/Pandas)  
- **Compliance-style reporting** (IPEDS/NYSED-style enrollment, retention, and graduation rates)  
- **Data quality automation** (validations, missing data checks, error logging)  
- **Interactive dashboards** (Tableau/Power BI mock-ups, Python visualizations)  

The project is inspired by real institutional research tasks such as **tracking enrollment trends, student retention, graduation rates, and survey outcomes**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → data cleaning, transformations, reporting automation  
- **SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL)** → relational queries for enrollment & retention  
- **Visualization** → Matplotlib/Seaborn for plots, Tableau/Power BI dashboards (screenshots)  
- **Excel/CSV** → mock institutional datasets

## 🎯 Key Features (Planned Deliverables)  
1. **Data Cleaning Pipeline**  
   - Handles missing values, outliers, invalid codes  
   - Generates a data quality summary report  

2. **Institutional Reporting**  
   - Enrollment by term, retention tracking, graduation rates  
   - Exportable reports (Excel/CSV/PDF)  

3. **Dashboarding**  
   - Tableau/Power BI dashboards for stakeholders  
   - Python visualizations (for reproducibility)  

4. **Survey Analysis**  
   - Student feedback survey analysis (mock data)  
   - Sentiment & trend reporting

## 📌 Why This Project?  
This project was built to align with responsibilities of an ** Data Analyst**:  
✔ Writing SQL queries to extract/analyze data  
✔ Automating compliance-style reports (IPEDS, NYSED)  
✔ Supporting cross-departmental stakeholders with clear dashboards  
✔ Maintaining **data integrity, accuracy, and usability**
