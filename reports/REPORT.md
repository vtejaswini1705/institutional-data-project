# Institutional Data Project â€“ Analysis Report

## Overview
This project simulates the type of data reporting and analysis done by an Institutional Data Analyst.  
It includes SQL scripts, Python data cleaning and visualization, and dashboards representing enrollment and retention trends.

## Dataset
- Source: Synthetic dataset (`data/sample_students.csv`)
- Columns: student_id, first_name, last_name, gender, age, major, enrollment_year
- Records: 100 synthetic student profiles

## Key Analyses & Visualizations
1. **Enrollment Trends**
   - Report: `reports/enrollment_by_year.png`
   - Shows growth and variation across academic years.

2. **Gender Distribution**

4. **Retention Rate by Enrollment Year**
   - Report: `reports/retention_by_year.png`

5. **Graduation Rate by Major**
   - Report: `reports/graduation_rate_by_major.png`

6. **Age Distribution**
   - Report: `reports/age_distribution.png`

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL**: Schema design, enrollment queries, retention calculations.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**: Data cleaning, analysis, visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory analysis.
- **Data Storytelling**: Transforming raw data into actionable insights.
